## Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II | Throwing knife analysis

### 1. Context
This data was collected during the annual life cycle (i.e., Oct. 2022 - Nov. 2023) of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II. Throwing knives were thrown from spawn at the start of each round in the game mode 'Search and Destroy.' Every time a knife hit and killed an opposing team member the corresponding data was recorded:
- The map name
- The date (in the format of y-m-d)
- The side the throw was made on (i.e., offense or defense)
- The in-game name of the player who was hit

The data is in the 'tidy' format (refer to https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html) and consists of 91 observations and four variables:
- map
- date
- side
- name
